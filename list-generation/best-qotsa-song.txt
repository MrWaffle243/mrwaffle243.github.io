--CANDIDATES--
You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire
No One Knows
Song for the Dead
Go With The Flow

Feel Good Hit of the Summer
The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret
Better Living Through The Chemistry
Monsters In the Parasol
In The Fade
Tension Head

Make It Wit Chu

I Sat by the Ocean
If I Had a Tail
Smooth Sailing
I Appear Missing

--Refined--
You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire
Song for the Dead
The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret
Monsters In the Parasol
In The Fade
